# SD Card (SDMMC) with ESP-Hosted example

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The ESP-IDF `master` branch has an issue that prevents the SD card and ESP-Hosted from working together when both are using SDMMC. See [ESP-IDF Issue 16233](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/issues/16233) for more information. This code contains a workaround for this issue.

This example demonstrates how to use an SD card on an ESP32-P4 dev board when ESP-Hosted is using SDIO to communicate with the on-board ESP32-C6. It has been modified from the standard [ESP-IDF SD Card example](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/examples/storage/sd_card/sdmmc).

This example does the following steps:

1. Initialise ESP-Hosted and Wi-Fi
1. Use an "all-in-one" `esp_vfs_fat_sdmmc_mount` function to:
    - initialize SDMMC peripheral,
    - probe and initialize an SD card,
    - mount FAT filesystem using FATFS library
    - register FAT filesystem in VFS, enabling C standard library and POSIX functions to be used.
1. Print information about the card, such as name, type, capacity, and maximum supported frequency.
1. Perform a Wi-Fi Scan
1. Create a file using `fopen` and write to it using `fprintf`.
1. Rename the file. Before renaming, check if destination file already exists using `stat` function, and remove it using `unlink` function.
1. Open renamed file for reading, read back the line, and print it to the terminal.
1. Perform another Wi-Fi Scan

This example supports SD (SDSC, SDHC, SDXC) cards and eMMC chips.

## Hardware

This example requires an ESP32-P4 development board with an SD card slot and an SD card. On this board, the SD card slot is assigned to SDMMC Slot 0, while the on-board ESP32-C6 is connected to the ESP32-P4 on SDMMC Slot 1.

Although it is possible to connect an SD card breakout adapter, keep in mind that connections using breakout cables are often unreliable and have poor signal integrity. You may need to use lower clock frequency when working with SD card breakout adapters.

This example doesn't utilize card detect (CD) and write protect (WP) signals from SD card slot.

### Pin assignments for SDMMC Slot 0 on ESP32-P4

On ESP32-P4, SDMMC Slot 0 GPIO pins cannot be customized. The GPIO assigned in the example should not be modified.

The table below lists the default pin assignments.

ESP32-P4 pin  | SD card pin | Notes
--------------|-------------|------------
GPIO43        | CLK         | 10k pullup
GPIO44        | CMD         | 10k pullup
GPIO39        | D0          | 10k pullup
GPIO40        | D1          | not used in 1-line SD mode; 10k pullup in 4-line mode
GPIO41        | D2          | not used in 1-line SD mode; 10k pullup in 4-line mode
GPIO42        | D3          | not used in 1-line SD mode, but card's D3 pin must have a 10k pullup

### 4-line and 1-line SD modes

By default, this example uses 4 line SD mode, utilizing 6 pins: CLK, CMD, D0 - D3. It is possible to use 1-line mode (CLK, CMD, D0) by changing "SD/MMC bus width" in the example configuration menu (see `CONFIG_EXAMPLE_SDMMC_BUS_WIDTH_1`).

Note that even if card's D3 line is not connected to the ESP chip, it still has to be pulled up, otherwise the card will go into SPI protocol mode.

## How to use example

### Build and flash

Build the project and flash it to the board, then run monitor tool to view serial output:

```
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

(Replace PORT with serial port name.)

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the Getting Started Guide for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.


## Example output

A Wi-Fi Scan is performed before and after accessing the SD Card. This shows that both SDMMC Slots work as expected.

## Troubleshooting

### Card fails to initialize with `sdmmc_init_sd_scr: send_scr (1) returned 0x107` error

Check connections between the card and the ESP32. For example, if you have disconnected GPIO2 to work around the flashing issue, connect it back and reset the ESP32 (using a button on the development board, or by pressing Ctrl-T Ctrl-R in IDF Monitor).

### Card fails to initialize with `sdmmc_check_scr: send_scr returned 0xffffffff` error

Connections between the card and the ESP32 are too long for the frequency used. Try using shorter connections, or try reducing the clock speed of SD interface.

### Failure to mount filesystem

```
example: Failed to mount filesystem.
```
The example will be able to mount only cards formatted using FAT32 filesystem.
